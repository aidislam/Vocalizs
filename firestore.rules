/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Vocalize application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, providing a clear hierarchical structure.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - The rules explicitly deny any unauthorized access attempts.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `id` (UID) is duplicated on the document to make validation easier and more secure.
