/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Vocalize application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own profile data.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed to prevent information disclosure.
 * - Flexible schema on writes is allowed during the prototyping phase.
 * - Enforces immutability for critical relational fields like `id`.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The User document's `id` field MUST match the `userId` path segment for authorization purposes.  This is enforced on create and immutability is enforced on update.
 * This ensures that users can only manage their own documents.

     * @allow (get) - User with UID 'user123' reads their profile at /users/user123.
     * @allow (update) - User with UID 'user123' updates their profile at /users/user123, without changing the id.
     * @allow (delete) - User with UID 'user123' deletes their profile at /users/user123.
     * @deny (create) - User with UID 'user456' attempts to create a profile at /users/user123.
     * @deny (get) - User with UID 'user456' attempts to read profile at /users/user123.
     * @deny (update) - User with UID 'user456' attempts to update the profile at /users/user123.
     * @deny (delete) - User with UID 'user456' attempts to delete the profile at /users/user123.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations and validates relational integrity.
