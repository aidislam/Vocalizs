/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Vocalize application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, with `userId` matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for privacy.
 * - The rules are designed to be authorization-centric, focusing on secure access control, and are flexible on data shapes to allow rapid iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `id` field within each `/users/{userId}` document MUST match the `userId` in the path. This redundancy enables efficient and secure ownership checks without additional database reads.
