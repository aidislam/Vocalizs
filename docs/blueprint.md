# **App Name**: Vocalize

## Core Features:

- Text Input: Users can input text into a text box.

- Playback Controls: Users can play, pause, stop, and adjust the volume and speed of the text-to-speech output.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), a calming hue reminiscent of sound waves and peaceful communication.
- Background color: Pale gray (#F5F5F5), nearly white, which allows the lavender primary color to stand out. This provides good contrast without causing harshness.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#9370DB). This color provides sufficient contrast to make interactive elements easily visible, while also fitting harmoniously within the overall palette.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a modern, friendly, and accessible sans-serif typeface suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for playback controls, volume settings, and voice selection. Icons should be easily recognizable and intuitive.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, with the text input area prominently displayed at the top. Voice selection and playback controls should be easily accessible below.
- Subtle animations, such as a visual representation of sound waves when the text is being spoken, can enhance the user experience.
